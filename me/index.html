    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div>
      <p>I am a versatile Full-Stack Developer at New York University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Integrated Digital Media and a Master of Science in Computer Science, with an expected graduation date of December 2023.</p>

      <p>Before getting into college, I have been a self-taught designer with well-rounded experiences in graphic, web, and UI/UX design. Nonetheless, programming has also been a hobby of mine since high school, and I have written a few interesting scripts in my free time for fun.</p>

      <p>After taking both some UX and digital design classes and some web development and computer science classes in college, however, I have started to realize that I don&rsquo;t want to just stop at creating user persona or Figma mockups&mdash;I want to build fully functional apps and websites in code that users can actually use on real devices.</p>

      <p>Since then, I have joined NYU IT as Student Web Developer and maintained and delivered numerous tools and modules that are being used by the university in production, from front-end web components to back-end mailers and QA automators, and I have self-learnt multiple languages and frameworks such as SCSS, Node.js, Vue.js, AWS, and PHP along the way.</p>

      <p>Inside and outside the classroom, I have worked on several full-stack web development projects, mostly using React.js or Vue.js for front end, Node.js and Express.js for back end and RESTful APIs, and Firebase or MongoDB for database. I have also developed a couple of iOS and watchOS applications using Swift, SwiftUI, and ARKit.</p>

      <p>Besides, I am a teaching assistant for Object Oriented Programming in C++ and I have worked as a tutor for Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.</p>
