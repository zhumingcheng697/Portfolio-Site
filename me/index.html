        <h1>My Story</h1>

        <b>(By the way, congratulations on finding this secret page!)</b>

        <div>
          <p>To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;ve never really thought about becoming a programmer until quite recently.</p>

          <p>Before getting into college, I&rsquo;ve always been a somewhat <i>traditional</i> digital designer. I know being a <i>digital</i> designer is already <i>not</i> traditional, but here by traditional I just mean 2D graphic design&mdash;things that can be done in Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Sketch, or their counterparts.</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;m a bit worried if I might get bored with such design work one day and I also know that these jobs typically don&rsquo;t pay very well. Because I have a special feeling for simplistic UIs and new technologies, and NYU also happens to offer a Bachelor of Science degree in this field, I wanted to follow a user experience track at IDM and ultimately work on the interaction between users and technologies in some big tech companies like Apple.</p>

          <p>However, as I began to seriously think about entering the UX design profession, I started to doubt if it is really what I wanted. As far as I know, most, if not all &ldquo;UX designers&rdquo; know little about programming&mdash;even though they seem to be working on some more interactive and advanced digital design, they are still creating &ldquo;fake&rdquo; mockups in image-processing softwares.</p>

          <p>Although I didn&rsquo;t know how to build a website or a mobile app back then, and neither did I know how to build mathematical models or computer games like some of my friends did in high school, at least I self-learned Swift a bit and wrote a few scripts that can, for instance, encode and decode morse code or generate QR code.</p>

          <p>Now that I&rsquo;ve actually learnt how to build simple websites and mobile apps, I think it will a pity if I were to become a UX designer and become only allowed to make those mockups when I actually know how to implement the design in code and build a fully functioning website or app from the ground up.</p>

          <p>As I was questioning myself and almost going through this existential crisis, it suddenly occurred to me that I can just become a front-end developer.</p>

          <p>As a front-end developer, not only would I be able to work on the user interfaces and interactions, I would also be able to use my code to bring the whole project to life, whether it is a website or an app. If I become a front-end developer, instead of being a designer having nowhere to make use of their programming expertise, I can be a programmer who is also an expert in design.</p>

          <p>Of course, if I want to work as a professional web or app developer, there will be many new skills that I would need to learn. Luckily, I still have a couple more years in college and hopefully I can make better use of them.</p>
